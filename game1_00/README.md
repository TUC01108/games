## Instead of relying solely on color changes and shaking, we can use small animal animations to represent unique and duplicate states.

## Animal Choices:

### Unique: A happy animal like a dog wagging its tail or a bird singing.
### Duplicate: A surprised animal like a cat with wide eyes or a bunny doing a double take.
